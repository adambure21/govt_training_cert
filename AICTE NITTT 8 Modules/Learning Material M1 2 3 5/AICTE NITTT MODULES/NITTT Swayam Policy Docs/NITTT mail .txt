Dear Sir/ Madam,

I don't understand why do we have to pay rupees 2000/- for just registration on NITTT Portal?

There are many Govt training organization like SWAYAM, NPTEL etc which does not require a single rupees for registration.

Why NITTT / NITTR Bhopal, Chennai etc are charging rupees 2000/- as registration fees ?

Is this registration fees is refundable ?

I think collection money under name of registration should not be objective of organizing body.

Just to register on NITTT portal, we have to pay 2000/- rs. Objective of Module 1 to 8 is to make technical teachers competent with changing technology and demand.but not to charge huge amount under name of registration charge.

If we attend training at NITTR Bhopal or any other extension center, Daily D.A + Travelling allowance + Accommodation etc  are paid by NITTR only.  
Now, for this online course, there is not TA DA need to pay, still NITTT is charning 2000/- for only registration.


I dont undetstand why do we need to pay 2000/- as part of registration charge. Apart from this 2000/-, NITTT is charging 1000/rs for each module.
