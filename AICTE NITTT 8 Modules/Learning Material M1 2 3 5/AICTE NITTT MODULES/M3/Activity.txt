ACTIVITY 

1. Think of a Classroom situation when you tried to communicate with a student. Or when a student tried to communicate with you,
 and it failed. Think about the problems or barriers that interfered with the communication.

I am lectuter and was working at a place which was a taluka place. many of my students were from rular area and some are from dstrict place.
Whenever i ask question or give a task to all students., almost all students were doing tasks correctly.But when i asked them to 
present task/activity on dice or infront of whole class, some of students were feeling uncomfortable.
Later, when i obsered some group of students and some other group who were activly doing task in front of class. I found following
reasons of their nature.


a)     Outline the situation and tell why you think it failed.

b)    List the reasons for failure identified by you.

- They were having discomfort with english language. (as they were from rular place)
- They felt that they are from rular area,earlier not having exposure to communication practises.
- They felt that students from district place were speking fluenty because district place students attended convent schools or semi-english schools
- Lack of resources was also a problem when i met with taluka place students
- Weak English proficiency

- Some how, i managed to motivate them that there is no such diffrence between students due to place. I motivated them that now 
here in this college, you have all resouces like libraray,internet, english sbject teachers etc,here you can improve communication skills.
later after a semister passed. I was clearly observing diffrence of coomunication skills between them at earlier stage and after passing one semester.
The skills were improvred. They buit up their stage daring,vocabulary,fluency etc.


Few facts.

Teacher-student interaction must be incresed to understand students problems.
